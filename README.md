Windows Phone 7 game as realy old project, for anyone whom's interested to pick it up and to bring it to the next level? 
See as example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWqrIAVCAnI
But now for WP7 with accelerometer as controls.

### Intro
A game back to old days, that I realy enjoyed playing, with scroll. But as updated version in C#, XNA 4.x, Windows Phone 7 (WP7.) For anyone whom is interested?
Based on WP7 with accelerometer as controls. Still interesting project, game development is different than building Cloud business soltutions as using vectors ;-)

### Tip
For all our students out there? Math? Vectors, Matrix and you love game development? Take special attention to this all ;-)

### Prerequisites
```
* Visual Studio 2005 / 2008? ( yes I know, it's old )
* C# XNA 4.x
* Tiled ( https://www.mapeditor.org/ ) Version unknown? 
* ( ^^ it was an old one ( will update, when known )).
```

### Todos
Update more information, to get interested contiributers going. But for now, we should get the context-pipeline with Tiled going again!
